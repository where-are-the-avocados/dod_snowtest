## What's this?

It contains map data files for custom multiplayer sessions for Half Life and Counter Strike, it is under development yet since it is not finished.

## Details

It is heavily based on dod_caen, with a few differences since I could not replicate it at 100%. I know it is clunky and it has a lot of errors; but it is the first map I've ever made. Every tip and critics will be gratefully accepted!
